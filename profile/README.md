# Ember Sample Apps

Project start date: May 9, 2022

Many web developers like to learn by looking at sample code. The purpose of this project is to have a place where sample Ember apps can live in one place for users to learn from. The best example of this is the [Super Rentals tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/) in the [official Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/).

## Participation

Everyone in the community is welcome to participate. If you have a sample application that you would like to contribute, please DM Melanie on the Ember community Discord server to discuss.

Each sample application will be given its own repo within this org.

### Sample Application Requirements

Sample applications should attempt to follow the following guidelines:

1. Apps should be as idiomatic as possible
2. Apps must be appropriate for developers of all ages
3. Apps may indicate the level of complexity in the app's readme
4. Apps should strive to demonstrate a single idea (no kitchen sink apps...unless that is the singular point of the demo)
5. Apps must have a LICENSE and CODE OF CONDUCT file in the repository 
6. Apps should attempt to follow WCAG success criteria for inclusive application demos

## Application Ideas

Here are some ideas for sample applications:

- [ ] an app to help you create a shopping list
- [ ] an app to help you track a habit's progress over time
- [ ] an app that allows you to browse products and add them to a shopping cart for purchase
- [ ] an app that manages inventory (perhaps of your personal reading library)
- [ ] an app that allows you to upload and share photos with family and friends
- [ ] an app that pulls publicly available data and displays it on a website
- [ ] an app that provides a form for users to fill out
- [ ] a blog
- [ ] an app to manage special dates and display reminders
- [ ] an app that shows the user what time it is in their own timezone no matter who is looking at the URL
- [ ] an app that aggregates available data for review
- [ ] an app that demonstrates a combination of technologies (like an Ember app connected to an Airtable, or an Ember app that uses something other than ember-data)

Have more ideas? Please share! Even if you are unable to implement the sample you would like to exist, maybe someone else is able to do it!
