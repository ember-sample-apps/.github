# Ember Sample Apps

Project start date: May 9, 2022

Many web developers like to learn by looking at sample code. The purpose of this project is to have a place where sample Ember apps can live in one place for users to learn from. The best example of this is the [Super Rentals tutorial](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/) in the [official Ember Guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/).

**Please note that I am a member of the [Ember Core Framework Team](https://emberjs.com/teams/), but this should not be considered an official Ember project at this time.**

## Participation

Everyone in the community is welcome to participate. If you have a sample application that you would like to contribute, please DM Melanie on the Ember community Discord server to discuss.

Each sample application will be given its own repo within this org.
Sample App contributors should be willing to regularly maintain the codebase or be willing to add other contributors to help maintain the codebase.
Projects that remain in a long-term neglected state will be deprecated.

### Sample Application Requirements

Sample applications should attempt to follow the following guidelines:

1. Apps should be as idiomatic as possible
2. Apps must be appropriate for developers of all ages
3. Apps may indicate the level of complexity in the app's readme
4. Apps should strive to demonstrate a single idea (no kitchen sink apps...unless that is the singular point of the demo)
5. Apps must have a [LICENSE](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) and [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project) file in the repository 
6. Apps should attempt to follow [WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) for inclusive application demos
7. Apps may add a sponsorship button if authors have an existing method to accept sponsorships

## Application Ideas

Here are some ideas for sample applications:

- [ ] an app to help you create a shopping list
- [ ] an app to help you track a habit's progress over time
- [ ] an app that allows you to browse products and add them to a shopping cart for purchase
- [ ] an app that manages inventory (perhaps of your personal reading library)
- [ ] an app that allows you to upload and share photos with family and friends
- [ ] an app that pulls publicly available data and displays it on a website
- [ ] an app that provides a form for users to fill out (and does any number of things with the results).
- [ ] a blog
- [ ] an app to manage special dates and display reminders
- [ ] an app that shows the user what time it is in their own timezone no matter who is looking at the URL
- [ ] an app that aggregates available data for review
- [ ] an app that demonstrates an integration of other tech (like an Ember app connected to an Airtable, or an Ember app that uses something other than ember-data)
- [ ] a chat app
- [ ] an app that demonstrates how to use the latest CSS hotness

Have more ideas? Of course you do!! Please share! Even if you are unable to implement the sample you would like to exist, maybe someone else is able to do it!

## Reasons to Participate

1. You are a developer who answers a lot of questions about Ember and would love to create a sample app to point people to
2. You don't feel comforable answering questions in chat, but wish you could contribute some other way- a sample app is a great way to do that!
3. You're learning Ember and want to build something practical (and, build your project portfolio at the same time!)
4. You have a ton of ideas but you haven't had a well-structured outlet for those ideas yet
5. You just wanna build websites

These are just _some_ of the reasons you might want to participate!
